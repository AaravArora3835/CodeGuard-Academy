### ðŸª² Common Error â†’ Hint Ideas

| Issue | Hint |
|--------|------|
| print error | Try adding quotes. Example: `print("Hello")` |
| syntax error | Check for missing colons or parentheses. |
| variable not defined | Make sure the variable name is spelled correctly and defined before use. |
| indentation error | Align your code blocks consistently (same spaces or tabs). |
| type error | Make sure you're using compatible data types (e.g., convert input to int if needed). |
| missing import | Did you forget an `import` statement at the top? 

# AI Hint Examples (Draft)

These are example hints the AI will provide to help students debug code.

| Code Problem | Example Hint |
|---------------|---------------|
| Missing quotes | "Try enclosing text inside quotation marks." |
| Indentation error | "Check the indentation levels â€” maybe a missing tab?" |
| Variable not defined | "Did you remember to declare that variable before using it?" |

## Next Steps
- Create `fake_hints.json` in backend for Flask to read.
- Later connect to OpenAI API (safe, low-cost mode).
